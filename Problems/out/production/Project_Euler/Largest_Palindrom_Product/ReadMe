A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two
-digit numbers is
9009 = 91 x 99

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two
 3 digit numbers.

 Intuition:
 We start our search from 999 x 999  [two multiples ]
 Idea to keep one constant while the 2nd multiple iterates
 The first palindrome to be found will be the largest one.

 Implementation
 Example of first round
 1) First check multiple 1 = 999 ; multiple 2 = 999
 2) if successful return the palindrome number where:
    palindrome number = multiple 1 x multiple 2

 3) if not successful multiple 2 must decrement before next check
    multiple 1 = 999 [stays the same] multiple 2 =998

 4)if successful do step 2

 5)if not successful repeat step 3 until multiple 2 =100

 6) No palindrome has been found so decrement multiple 1 [998] and set multiple 2 to 998
    then go on to repeat from 2 until multiple 1 reaches 100
 7) if no palindrome number exists return 0;

 First Run
 580085 is largest palindrome returned multiple1 = 995 and multiple2 583
 this is wrong

 906609 is the correct answer. Initial thought was that the first palindrome would be the correct one.
 That the multiples would be a multiple of 999 turned out not to be the case. and thus program gave a
 palindrome lower down.
